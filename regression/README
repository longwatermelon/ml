Polynomial regression is the same as linear regression, just with the graph x and data point x values modified the same.
For example, to fit a quadratic curve, the curve will have an equation of wx^2 + b, and each data point x will be squared.

Note: linear.cpp does not implement feature scaling, which may cause the program to crash under other datasets.
